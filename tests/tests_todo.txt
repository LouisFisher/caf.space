testing inputs folder:

geo_utils._cols_in_both:
    Returns both dataframes with lowercase columns
    Returns correct list of matching columns names, case insensitively

geo_utils._var_apply:
    Can join weighting to correspondence with matching id cols
    Returns number of none matching zones for none matching id

geo_utils._zone_split:
    Returns correct weighting translation
    Possibly break function down further for more thorough testing?

zone_correspondence.read_zone_shapefiles:
    Raises FileNotFound error if path doesn't exist
    Raises error for faulty path
    Raises message for incorrect CRS
    Assert returned gdf has correct CRS

zone_correspondence._spatial_zone_correspondence:
    Check spatial correspondence is correct
    Error for wrong format of zones input

zone_correspondence._find_slithers:
    Assert returns combined equal to input
    Assert slithers meets tolerance

zone_correspondence._rounding_correction:
    Grouped by each zone system goes to 1
    No values less than zero

zone_correspondence._missing_zones_check:
    Assert returns missing zones correctly

ZoneTranslation test:
    _run_spatial_translation:
        Check spatial translation is correct compared against expected output
        Check missing zones warning is correct

    _find_lower_translation:
        finds lower translation correctly when it should
        Doesn't return lower translation for updated shapefile
        Correct warning for missing metadata
        Correct warning for no lower translation

    ZoneTranslation:
        Grouped by each zone system sum to 1
        No values in either column less than zero
        Correct number of missing zones warned about
        zone columns identical between spatial and weighted
